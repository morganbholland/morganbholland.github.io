Welcome to the personal website of Morgan Holland. I am an economist working for the Center for Business and Economic Analysis (CBEA) at the University of Wyoming. If you are looking to interact with me in a professional capacity, here's the website for the [CBEA](http://www.uwyo.edu/CBEA/index.html).

The links at the top of the page will take you to pages where you can learn more about me, including my research and teaching experience, copies of my CV/resume (which may be out-of-date), and a blog where I will occasionally post about data, economics, and random coding things I do.

I also plan on using this website as a work space to improve my website development and coding skills, so expect some dust.
